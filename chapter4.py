# Chapter 4: The Mysterious Figure

# In this chapter, Wei Wuxian encounters a mysterious figure
# that may hold important information about his past. The player
# has to decide how to handle the situation and what to learn
# from the encounter.

# Key Features:
# - The player can choose to learn more about Wei Wuxianâ€™s past
#   through a vision, but it costs some spiritual energy.
# - The player can choose to fight the figure, which will lead
#   to a battle where they can win or lose.
